JTZS
====

Action shooting game inspired by Phobia game series.

This game was originally developed in spring 2009 as my final assignment for course TIE0256 in University of Jyväskylä.

Almost 4 years later I found the source code of JTZS from my archives and got an idea to publish it. My plan is to keep
improving the game when ever I find enough time for it. 

You can use my code as you like. If you manage to create something cool with my code I would like to hear about it. :)
